                        <h3>Study History</h3>
                        <p>I went to High-school at St. Peters Lutheran College, Indooroopilly and graduated in the class of 2013. During my time at school I was interested in Maths (C & B), Physics and Information Technology. Both my parents came from an IT background as Computer Science subjects in university were first emerging, so its no wonder I enjoyed these subjects. I consider myself quite a rationale thinker, and thorougly enjoyed these subjects. Thus, I ended up finishing High-school with an OP-5. </p> 
                        <p>However, when it came to university I didn't continue with mathematics by pursing Engineering, or even IT through a Computer Science Degree. I think that although I was good at these subjects at school, I didn't want my job to revolve around Mathematics espeically. So, I did some research and found that I was interested in Psychology and studied a Bachelor of Psychology Science at the University of Queensland for four years. This allowed me to develop quite strong interpersonal and comunication skills, but again I didnt find motivation to pursue this tragectory and I didnt want to become a Psychologist.</p>
                        <p>
                            <em>
                            So, how did I end up re-igniting my passion for IT and find myself studying a Diploma of Information Techology at Coder Academy in 2023?

                        <h3>Work History</h3>
                        <p>During school I had a few odd jobs for shorter periods of time here and there. The most notable being at Hoppies Carwash at Toowong roundabout when I was 15. This was an interesting job for someone of my age because it was physical labour and quite tiring cleaning around 300 cars with a team on a busy day, however in the same vein they also payed us extremely well compared to the average 15 year old wage. I worked at hobbies for around 6 months before I had to quit as school and extra-curricular activities prooved too time consuming</p>
                        <p> Through-out university I worked as a Casual Sales Assistant at a Menswear store. This retail sales job helped me develop excellent communication skills with all members of the wider community, made me efficient in sales and gave me a drive to meet set KPI standards or company targets/budgets. I did all of this while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. </p>
                        <p> After working in Retail Sales for around 6 years I wanted to further develop my Sales skills, but in a field of interest. This lead to me think about my history with IT. I started to search for Recruitment jobs revolving around IT and I become a Cyber Security Recruiter. This re-opened a whole new world of IT for me and I was fascinated learning about Security Analysts, Engineers, Architects, Penetration Testers, Incident Response teams and the work they did. However after some time in Recruitment, I decided that I wanted to be a professional in IT and develop my own skillset, rather than sell someone else's.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>
                            This was how I re-ignited my passion for IT and transitioned from Retail Sales, to IT Sales and now to building my own IT skillset in Full Stack Web Development at Coder Academy.

                        <h3>Interests</h3>
                        <p>As I mentioned above, growing up both my parents were into IT, so naturally I have always been around computers and the latest technologies. I still have my dads original Ipod Classic to this day. At a young age I loved playing Pokemon Sapphire on my Gameboy Advanced, and remember spending ridiculous time playing Pokemon Emerald when the GameboySP came out. This was what started me down the road of gaming which I would say is one of my biggest passions. I transitioned into Console gaming on the original Xbox with Halo 2 online and continued playing Halo 3, and Modern Warfare 2 on the Xbox 360. These days you can find me on a gaming PC, mainly playing League of Legends, Counter Strike or Rocket League.</p>

                        <p>Luckily, to balance out my gaming interests, I thoroughly enjoy anything athletic or sport related. My biggest passion when it comes to physical activities is Football (Soccer for the uncultured reader). I've played football my whole life from the age of 6, where I started playing club football until around 16. Currently I play 5-Aside Indoor Futsal every Wednesday night, and 7-aside Football on the Astroturf pitch at UQ every Sunday. Aside from football, I am really into Formula 1, Indoor Rock Climbing (Bouldering) and going on Hikes.</p>
