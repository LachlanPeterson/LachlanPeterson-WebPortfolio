                    <h3>Buddy visits North Stradbroke Island</h3>
                    <p>This was the first time we took our dog Buddy - a Shih Tzu / Maltese cross - to North Stradbroke Island. The picture was taken on the Gorge Walk off Point Lookout on a beautiful summer day. Buddy loved the beaches around Straddie, and would run in the wind to his hearts content. Him and I would often have a race down the beach, and although he was very small and needed to take around 8 steps for my 1 long stride, he was still faster. When the wind was blowing against him, he looked like the Dragon from 'The Never Ending Story'. </p>

                    <h3>First International trip, destination Japan</h3>
                    <p>In 2018, my girlfriend and I decided to have our first international trip together in Japan. We flew from the Gold Coast to the Narita International Airport in Japan before hopping on a train to Shibuya Station. After arriving at Shibuya Station and going through a maze that is the Japanese underground train system, we walked out to see Shibuya Crossing at 11pm. It was a cold, windy night in Japan, but Shibuya was alive, and I remember being amazed at how many people were crossing the road. Every 2 minutes there would be an influx of hundreds of people that seemingly came from nowhere. </p>

                    <h3>Wedding duties: Australian Flag Bearer</h3>
                    <p>I had never previously attended a wedding before and all of a sudden I was thrust into a cultural experience. My partners sister was getting married and her fiance had asked me to join the Groomsman. Not only that, but I was asked to be the Australian Flag bearer for the ceremony and different cultural practices that came with the territory of a Serbian Wedding. It's safe to say I had a fantastic time partying, drinking and celebrating their marriage, as one of the only Australians in attendance. It was an amazing experience and the Serbian culture was incredible. </p>

                    <h3>The Culture of Italy</h3>
                    <p>In 2019, I was lucky enough to travel to Italy. We visted Florence, Rome and Venice and as you can imagine the culture, tradition and people were outstanding. Italian culture is so rich with arts, architecture, music and great food. This was highlighted when we visited places like St. Peter's Basillica, Vatican City, The Trevi Fountain, The colosseum, and countless art museums. There are many special places in Italy, however the highlight of my trip had to be riding a Gondola through the Canals of Venice and under the Rialto Bridge at Sunset with my Girlfriend. It's hard to imagine a more romantic city in the world. </p>

                    <h3>Learning to Snowboard in Japan</h3>
                    <p>I just couldn't stay away from Japan, so in 2020 I went back. But this time it was a completely different dynamic... a Skiing/Snowboarding holiday with 12 of my close male friends from High-school. This was the definition of a boys trip, as we stayed a Cabin around Hakuba, hitting the slopes during the day and having a few drinks at night. This was also when I learned Snowboarding for the first time - regrettably without lessons. Although I took a beating from the Japanese slopes of Hakuba on the first day, I was able to pick it up relatively quickly as I used to surf a lot in my Teenage years. By the end of the trip, I was flying down the Mountains. </p>
